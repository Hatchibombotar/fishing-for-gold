Dear Human,
In case you've forgotten or can't see that sign
you placed there, you can sell your items by
chucking them down that hole.

How it works I have no idea.

Thanks,

Dear Human,
I've created a shop!

You can spend your money there and I'll send you
some useful items.

Press "E" to access it.

Maybe I'll even turn your water back on ;)

Thanks,
Your Friendly Neighbour

Dear Human,
Thanks again for the money.

Check the shop - I've been working hard
on some technology to make fishing faster.

Too bad you aren't catching fish.

Thanks,

Dear Human,

With the money you've given me, I am planning
to have a fifty course meal.

You won't be joining me.

Dear Human,

You've been working so excellently recently.

As a reward, I've added a new upgrade to the
shop, that you can pay me to recieve.

Thanks for your complacency,

Dear Human,

You are spending too much time moving around.
I am now offering a new hole in the shop.

Stay sedentary,

Don't be greedy.

I'm keeping the money.
